## Relevant Files
`resnet_experiment.py` trains the baseline approach that was used for comparison against our method. It is our implemenation of the work in [Kather et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7423299/).

`moco_experiment.py` is used to train a patch feature extractor using [momentum contrast learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04297).

`downstream_experiment.py` uses the trained feature extractor from `moco_experiment.py` to now train a group-patch level MLP which can classify WSI's with higher accuracy.
