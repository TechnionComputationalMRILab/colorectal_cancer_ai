## Detecting Colorectal Cancer MSI/MSS Status From High Resolution WSI with Deep Learning
This repo contains code used in the paper "Patient-level Microsatellite Stability Assessment from Whole Slide Images By Combining Momentum Contrast Learning and Group Patch Embeddings" by Shats et al. This paper will appear in the proceedings of the ECCV workshop on Medical Computer Vision (ECCV-MCV 2022). You can also read it on Arxiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10429).

## Relevant Files
`resnet_experiment.py` trains the baseline approach that was used for comparison against our method. It is our implemenation of the work in [Kather et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7423299/).

`moco_experiment.py` is used to train a patch feature extractor using [momentum contrast learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04297).

`downstream_experiment.py` uses the trained feature extractor from `moco_experiment.py` to now train a group-patch level MLP which can classify WSI's with higher accuracy.
